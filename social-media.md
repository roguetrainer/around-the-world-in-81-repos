🌍 AROUND THE WORLD IN 8️⃣1️⃣ REPOS: 🧭 A JOURNEY THROUGH HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION 🧠🤝🤖

I'm on an unusual research expedition: creating 8️⃣1️⃣ 👋🌍 "HELLO WORLD" REPOSITORIES across ANALYTICAL MODELLING—from QUANTUM COMPUTING to ECONOMICS, STATISTICAL PHYSICS to FINANCIAL MODELLING. 

🧠🤝🤖 The twist? Each one built IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AI (mostly Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Google Gemini).

Why 81, not 80? Plot spoiler from Jules Verne: Phileas Fogg experienced 🌅 81 sunrises traveling eastward, though his London friends counted only 80 days. The extra day represents the perspective gained from making the complete journey. 🪂

The Real Story: THE TRIFECTA 🔺
1️⃣ 🧠 Human intuition & domain expertise
2️⃣ 🤖 LLM-powered code generation  
3️⃣ 🛠️ Traditional stats, ML & numerical models & tools

Together, these three form something greater than the sum of parts. 

👩‍🏫 What We Are Actually Learning:
This isn't about my or your coding ability - it's about mastering human-AI collaboration. The new essential skills are:
• 🪟 Context window management
• 🕺🏽 Conversational choreography with AI
• ✅ Quality control (brilliant vs. plausible-but-wrong vs. hallucinated)
• 🧭 Strategic direction (AI generates; humans decide what's worth solving)
• 🗄️ Project archaeology across multiple sessions

🧰 The Tooling Landscape:
We're deliberately exploring languages (Python, R, F#, Q#, JavaScript) and frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, Q# for quantum; PyTorch, JAX for ML; Stan for Bayesian inference) to answer: Which tool for which problem?

🫣 Like Fogg's whirlwind tour, these aren't deep dives—they're glimpses. Quick and dirty implementations to understand concepts, compare frameworks, and build effective AI partnerships.

😳 The Humbling Truth:
Ada Lovelace (1843): "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform." (Mostly still true, for now!)

🐈‍⬛ Still true 180 years later. The AI wrote the code. But the collection—this particular breadth, these specific connections—required human intention and curiosity.

📆 Fred Brooks (1975) said adding programmers to late projects makes them later. But LLM collaborators change the equation: zero onboarding, instant context switching, polyglot fluency, no ego. It doesn't replace human expertise—it amplifies what we're uniquely good at.

🗑️ The repos are messy. Plenty of cruft to refactor. That's the point. The skill isn't writing perfect code—it's effective collaboration with AI while keeping human judgment engaged.

🤔 Jules Verne: "Anything one can imagine, we can make real."

In 2025, that "we" includes our AI partners.

> Actually, I asked AI to translate from 19-century speak. Verne orginally said:    
🇫🇷 *"Tout ce qu'un homme est capable d'imaginer, d'autres hommes seront capables de le réaliser."*   
🇬🇧 *"Anything __one man__ can imagine, __other men__ can make real."*    
Verne's universal insights transcend his era's gendered language - indeed, his optimistic view applies to all human potential and scientific advancement.
