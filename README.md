# Around the World (of Analytical Modelling) in 81 Repos 🌍

*A journey through numerical research, powered by human creativity and AI collaboration*

> 🪂 *"I see that it is by no means useless to travel, if a man\* wants to see something new."* – Jules Verne, **Around the World in Eighty Days**

> 🧮 *"In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science."*  
— Ada Lovelace, **Notes on the Analytical Engine** (1843)

> 💭 *"Anything one man\* can imagine, other men\* can make real."*

\* Verne's 19th-century language aside, his vision was universal, and today includes humans of all genders collaborating with AI. 🤗


## The Trifecta of Modern Research

```
🧠 Human Intuition & Domain Expertise
        ↕
🤖 LLM-Powered Code Generation & Exploration  
        ↕
🎲 Traditional Stats, ML & Numerical Tools
```

**Together, these three form a powerful partnership where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.**

## What Is This Project?

This repository collection is an experiment in rapid numerical research acceleration using the latest LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Google Gemini). It demonstrates how humans and AI can collaborate to explore diverse analytical domains—from quantum computing to economics, from statistical mechanics to financial modeling.

## The Real Skill? Human-AI Collaboration

*"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."*  
— Ada Lovelace (1843)

*"The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities."*  
— Edsger W. Dijkstra

**Humble brag**: Writing code is surprisingly easy when an agentic LLM does the heavy lifting. But that's exactly the point.

Forget waiting for AGI—that might be decades away. Right now, in 2025, we have something immediately useful: AI systems that need us as much as we need them. This isn't about replacing human developers; it's about **augmenting human capability** through effective partnership.

### The New Core Competencies

Look through these repositories and you'll find plenty of cruft—inconsistent naming, redundant functions, documentation drift, architectural decisions that made sense at 2am but not at 2pm. Refactoring and tidying this will take hours of patient human-AI collaboration. 

**And that's the skill we all need to master**: 

- **Context window management**: What information does the AI need right now? What can be summarized? What must be preserved verbatim?
- **Project archaeology**: Reconstructing the reasoning behind past decisions when you're the one who made them three weeks ago
- **Conversational choreography**: Knowing when to be precise, when to be vague, when to ask for alternatives, when to just say "make it work"
- **Institutional memory**: Keeping records of who asked what, when decisions were made, why approaches were abandoned
- **Quality control**: Recognizing when AI output is brilliant, when it's plausible-but-wrong, and when it's hallucinated nonsense
- **Strategic direction**: The AI can generate implementations all day, but *you* decide what problems are worth solving

### The Humbling Truth

These 81 repositories don't showcase my coding prowess—they showcase (hopefully some!) **effective collaboration with AI tools**. That's not a lesser skill; it's the *essential* skill for modern technical work. 

The bottleneck isn't typing speed or memorizing APIs anymore. It's:
- Asking the right questions
- Providing the right context
- Recognizing good output from bad
- Maintaining coherence across multiple sessions
- Knowing which problems to tackle and in what order

This is the new literacy: **working effectively with AI collaborators while keeping your human judgment engaged**.

The code in these repos? Any competent LLM could write it. The *collection* of these 81 repos, covering this particular breadth, exploring these specific trade-offs, making these connections? That required human intention, curiosity, and direction.

That's the skill worth developing.

### The Philosophy

These aren't polished, production-ready packages. They're **quick-and-dirty explorations** designed to:

- **Learn fast**: Understand individual models and techniques through hands-on implementation
- **Build partnerships**: Discover how to work effectively with AI collaborators, each playing to their strengths
- **Accelerate discovery**: See how many meaningful examples can be created in a short time
- **Challenge assumptions**: The famous "Mythical Man-Month" suggested adding programmers to late projects makes them later. But what happens when one of those "programmers" is an LLM that never sleeps, never gets tired, and can switch contexts instantly?

## "Hello World" Across Disciplines

Much like Phileas Fogg racing around the world without time to linger in any location, these repositories are often **"Hello World" examples** from each discipline—just enough to understand the core concepts and get something running, then move on to the next destination.

The goal isn't deep expertise in any single area, but breadth of exposure and understanding of how different analytical tools and frameworks compare. You get a taste of quantum computing with Qiskit, then jump to econometric modeling in R, then explore time-series analysis in Python—always asking: "What's this tool good for? How does it feel to use? What problems does it solve elegantly?"

## Exploring the Tooling Landscape

> *"The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our thinking habits, and, therefore, on our thinking abilities."*  
> — Edsger W. Dijkstra

A key objective is **comparing different languages, frameworks, and libraries** to understand their strengths and use cases:

### Languages
- **Python**: Dominant in data science and ML; used for most implementations
- **R**: Statistical analysis and econometric modeling
- **SQL**: Data manipulation and analytical queries
- **F#**: Functional programming for quantitative finance
- **Q#**: Microsoft's quantum programming language
- **Power Query**: Microsoft's data mash-up language - python meets SQL
- **JavaScript**: Web-based visualizations and interactive demos

### Quantum Computing Frameworks
- **Qiskit** (IBM): Circuit-based quantum computing
- **PennyLane**: Quantum machine learning and differentiable programming
- **Q#**: Microsoft's quantum development kit
- **Cirq** (Google): Quantum circuits for NISQ devices

### Other Key Libraries & Frameworks
- **PyTorch & TensorFlow**: Deep learning
- **NumPy, SciPy, pandas**: Scientific computing
- **Stan, PyMC**: Bayesian inference
- **NetworkX**: Graph algorithms
- **QuantLib**: Financial derivatives pricing
- **Mesa**: Agent-based modeling
- **JAX**: Differentiable computing
- **Plotly, D3.js**: Interactive visualization

The variety helps answer practical questions: When should I use PyTorch vs JAX? Is Qiskit or PennyLane better for variational algorithms? Can F# really make financial code more maintainable?

## Why 81 Repos (Not 80)?

> **Plot spoiler alert from Jules Verne's classic!**
>
> Phileas Fogg circled the globe in 80 days from his London friends' perspective. But for Fogg and Jean Passepartout, traveling eastward meant experiencing 81 sunrises—each day 1/80th shorter than back at the Reform Club. 
>
> Similarly, this journey through analytical modeling isn't just about reaching the end—it's about the perspective gained along the way. The 81st repo represents the insight that comes from having made the complete journey.

Why stop at 80 if we're having fun? And 81 is just a more interesting number than 80!

## Repository Structure

Each of the 81 repositories typically includes:
- **Implementation**: Working code with examples (language varies by topic)
- **Documentation**: README explaining the model/method
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks or interactive demos where appropriate
- **Setup**: Requirements and installation instructions (requirements.txt, environment.yml, etc.)
- **References**: Links to papers, books, and resources

## Getting Started

Browse the individual repositories to find topics that interest you. Each is self-contained and can be explored independently. Some complement each other—quantum computing repos build on linear algebra repos, economics repos connect to statistical methods.

**Fair warning**: Like Fogg's whirlwind tour, you'll get a glimpse of each destination but not deep immersion. These are starting points for deeper exploration, not definitive treatments.

## Philosophy on Completeness

**These implementations are not meant to be complete, production-ready, or even entirely correct.** They are:

- **Learning tools**: Quick explorations to understand concepts
- **Prototypes**: Starting points for deeper investigation  
- **Experiments**: Tests of what's possible with LLM collaboration
- **Provocations**: Invitations to think differently about research workflows
- **Tool comparisons**: Side-by-side evaluations of different frameworks

The goal isn't perfection—it's velocity of insight and breadth of exposure.

## The New Mythical Man-Month

Oh my! - a half century since [*The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) was published in 1975!

Fred Brooks famously argued that adding people to a late software project makes it later, because communication overhead scales quadratically. But LLM collaborators change this calculus:

- **Zero onboarding time**: Context provided through prompts
- **Instant context switching**: Move between quantum physics and finance seamlessly
- **Parallel exploration**: Multiple implementations can be developed simultaneously
- **Polyglot fluency**: Write Python, then R, then F# without cognitive overhead
- **No ego or politics**: Just focus on the problem

This doesn't make human expertise less valuable—it makes it *more* valuable by freeing us to focus on what we do best: asking good questions, providing domain knowledge, making creative connections, and choosing the right tools for the job.
